# Unfilled Market Concern Output (UMCO)

**UMCO is an innovative project combining Natural Language Processing and time series models to summarize the causes of and predict volatility for commodities (e.g., gold, oil).**

This project analyzes daily market news, extracts key information, and integrates it into sophisticated financial models to provide users with deep market insights and potential risk warnings.

## Project Workflow

The UMCO project achieves its functionality through the following workflow:

## Project Modules Explained

UMCO consists of three core modules:

### 1. Market Daily Briefing

This module serves as the project's data input and initial analysis layer.

*   **Functionality**:
    *   Automatically scrapes daily commodity-related news from sources like Nasdaq and Barchart.
    *   Utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and summarize news content, e.g., "Stocks Finish Higher on Chip Stock Strength and Healthy US Labor Market."
    *   Generates a market summary detailing price movements of major commodities (gold, oil, etc.), and their potential underlying causes.
    *   Maintains and updates a dynamic list of "Risk Factors" reflecting current market concerns.
*   **Example Tech Stack**: Python (Requests, BeautifulSoup/Scrapy for scraping), NLTK/spaCy/Transformers (for NLP).
*   **Output**: Structured market summary text, list of risk factors.

### 2. Analysis & Modeling

This is the core analytical engine of the project, combining financial econometrics with textual information.

*   **Functionality**:
    *   Employs a **Conditional Heteroskedasticity Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** to model market volatility.
    *   A unique aspect of the model is that its state transition probabilities or heteroskedasticity parameters are dynamically influenced by **textual information extracted from Module 1** (e.g., market sentiment, frequency of specific risk factor mentions).
    *   Models the market Volatility Surface, capturing the complex behavior of volatility under different conditions.
*   **General Formula Example (for the conditional heteroskedasticity part, e.g., GARCH(1,1) within an HMM state S_t)**:
    Within a given state *s<sub>t</sub>* of the Hidden Markov Model, the conditional variance *σ<sub>t</sub><sup>2</sup>* of returns *r<sub>t</sub>* can be expressed as:
    *r<sub>t</sub> = μ<sub>s<sub>t</sub></sub> + ε<sub>t</sub>*
    *ε<sub>t</sub> = σ<sub>t</sub> z<sub>t</sub>*,  where *z<sub>t</sub> ~ N(0,1)* (or other distribution)
    *σ<sub>t</sub><sup>2</sup> = ω<sub>s<sub>t</sub></sub> + α<sub>s<sub>t</sub></sub> ε<sub>t-1</sub><sup>2</sup> + β<sub>s<sub>t</sub></sub> σ<sub>t-1</sub><sup>2</sup>*
    Where:
        *   *μ<sub>s<sub>t</sub></sub>* is the expected return in state *s<sub>t</sub>*.
        *   *ω<sub>s<sub>t</sub></sub>, α<sub>s<sub>t</sub></sub>, β<sub>s<sub>t</sub></sub>* are the GARCH model parameters, which can vary across different states *s<sub>t</sub>*.
        *   **Key Innovation**: These parameters *ω, α, β*, or the HMM's state transition probabilities, can be further modeled as functions of textual features *T<sub>t-1</sub>* (e.g., sentiment scores, specific keyword frequencies) extracted from Module 1:
            *e.g., ω<sub>s<sub>t</sub></sub> = f(T<sub>t-1</sub>)*
*   **Module Showcase**: An interactive HTML output example for this module is embedded in the section below.

### 3. Visualization Module

This module is responsible for presenting the complex model outputs and data analysis results in an intuitive manner.

*   **Functionality**:
    *   Generates price attribution time series charts.
    *   Clearly displays the relationship between commodity price fluctuations and various driving factors (including events extracted from news and risk factors identified by the model).
    *   Helps users understand how specific market events impact price dynamics.
*   **Module Showcase**: An interactive HTML output example for this module is embedded in the section below.
